# uwuEdit
## an awful text editor, made in C

### What is uwuEdit?
uwuEdit is an awful text editor that Veikko wrote at night because who tf sleeps. It has no config file, no customizability and doesn't even work. It's as simple of a text editor, but atleast on Veikko's computer it didn't even work. You shouldn't use it because it doesn't work.

### Why are you putting it on github then?
Because we need more uwuTools.

### How do i install it?
Delete the `uwuEdit` file and then just run `make`. 

Then copy the new `uwuEdit` file to `/usr/bin` and run `ln -sr /usr/bin/uwuEdit /bin/uwuEdit`.

:wq
